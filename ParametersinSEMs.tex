Parameters
» parameters are constants
» indicate the nature and size of the
relationship between two variables in the
population
» we can never know the true value of a
parameter, but statistics help us make our
best guess
• Parameters in SEM
» can be specified as “fixed” (to be set equal
to some constant like zero)
» or “free” (to be estimated from the data)
• Parameters in other techniques
» Pearson correlation: one parameter is
estimated (r)
» Regression: regression coefficients are
estimated
